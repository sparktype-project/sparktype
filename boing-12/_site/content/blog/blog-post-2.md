  Sometimes it happens. That’s the danger of client work. After years of working
  at a web agency, here are a few things I’ve learned. 
---

* &#x20;Most people are terrible at expressing what they want. Spend time up front exploring style ideas and get them signed off before starting on the designs.&#x20;
* \* If the client starts editing the designs, the project is done for. Just try to wrap it up asap.&#x20;
* \* Move quickly. The longer a project takes the more time the client has to unpick previous decisions. You don’t want them to feel rushed but you also don’t want to give them time to start thinking too hard.&#x20;
* \* Some projects fail. Mostly due to a communication breakdown somewhere. Practice good communication.&#x20;
* \* Some clients suck. For whatever reason they won’t accept the advice of the professionals they’re paying for. Explain why it’s a bad idea, but do what they want. Put your original designs in your portfolio and move on.&#x20;
* \* Get it written in the contract that feedback must be full and final. No drip-feed of comments. Also get it up front that you will do 2 rounds of amends. Any more changes are billed hourly.&#x20;
* \* Get it written up front that changing earlier decisions will also be billed hourly. Make sure key decisions are recorded somewhere.&#x20;
* \* If a prospective client has a terrible website, be careful. It’s rarely the fault of their previous developers.&#x20;
* \* Getting a new website is like getting a new haircut. It takes a lot of trust and courage. People want to make big changes at first but start toning it down almost immediately. If you’re not careful it’ll end up looking just like their old one.&#x20;
