# Sparktype

### Publishing made easy

Sparktype is a browser-based publishing platform that combines the ease of use of a content management system with the performance and simplicity of a static site generator.

### Prinicples

**Simplicity**

Sparktype deliberately takes a content-first approach, favouring readability and accessibility over complex layouts and features. Sites are pure HTML and CSS (with just a tiny bit of Javascript), meaning they can be hosted almost anywhere and read by almost anything.

**Security**Â 

Being completely static, Sparktype sites do not need ongoing maintenance or security updates. As the editor runs entirely locally in your browser, no private information is uploaded or published and there is no tracking by default.

**Usability**

With a simple but powerful editing interface, Sparktype handles the complexity of building and publishing your site enabling you to focus on your content.
